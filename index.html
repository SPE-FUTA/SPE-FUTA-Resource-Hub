    <h2 class="title"> Machine Learning

    </h2>

  Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. This section consists of materials and links to online resources for members intending to gain expertise in machine learning and data engineering.

  <h2 class="title"> Mineral Processing</h2>
Mineral processing, art of treating crude ores and mineral products in order to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock, or gangue. It is the first process that most ores undergo after mining in order to provide a more concentrated material for the procedures of extractive metallurgy. This section consists of materials and links to online resources for members intending to gain expertise in mineral processing.
