    <h2 id="ml"> Machine Learning</h2>
   <div>Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. This section consists of materials and links to online resources for members intending to gain expertise in machine learning and data engineering.
